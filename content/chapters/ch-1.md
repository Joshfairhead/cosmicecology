Astropoiesis represents the notion of self making cosmos. The term branches out of the Maturana & Verela term "autopoiesis" wich refers to self maiking organisms, while implying a cosmic ecology that incorporates terresterial wisdom. 

Similarly, Whitehead puts life, organisms and ecology at the center of his Process Philosophy but due to the terminology already carrying baggage it seems worth updating this in order to synthesise it with other works.  

Astropoiesis is a term that refers to a cosmology of levels broadly categorised as sub-animate, animate and super-animate existence, which correspondingly enables a dynamism between the material world, the living world and the more than living world.

These correspond to a set of interacting levels called the 'apokritikal levels of being' in Bennetts work:

However, the idea of astropoiesis should not be confined to the three categories or twelve levels shown as it's a symbolic reference to a wider set of processes. Depending on the languages you speak you might call it different things like a category of exponentials, morphisms or functors if your mathmatically inclined, though this is not encompassing either. 

This is perhaps why the slides are misleading at a deeper level; astropoiesis is not the labels, it is an encapsulating term for all the possible connections between them, as well as other schemas. You might say its a point of departure that allows us to symbolise an understanding.
