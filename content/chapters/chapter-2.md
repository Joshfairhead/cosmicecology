Fair warning: we're diving into this expedition holographically and/or hermeneutically. We'll be exploring cosmology in a spherical manner, circling around the big ideas and morphing between clarity and confusion with enough wobble to challenge even the most seasoned psychonaut. Buyer beware.

If you want everything laid out logically and precisely, Bennett's your scholar. If you prefer simple and friendly, Hodgson will serve you well. If you're curious about the wanderings of a well-read crackpot, one reaching beyond the veil regularly enough to have his head pop out the other side then welcome, you've found the right website. 

Hodgson's major contribution is offering criteria for what makes a meaningful cosmology. This matters because cosmologies come in countless forms, and making sense of them all is, quite frankly, a magnificent ball ache - yet utterly fascinating!

If you decide to go dumpster diving in the back of the spiritual supermarket, you will find all sorts of tasty tales and odd phenemona. There are a million meta theories and plenty of religions and creation myths. Panpsychic phenomena and quantumn decoherence. Psychedellic pills and artificial sentient intelligence. Between the cracks there is a set of explanitory principals that can be used to explain it all, but that's not what actually matters.  

But I digress; applied cosmology is all these things. Whatever your pet 



They all claim to be the one true god or the most meta theory of the meta theories etc. and despite them all pointing at the same moon, they are usually imbalanced. 

To keep things personal: I've read widely and explored strange territories. We could catalog them all (perhaps someday I will), but for now let's cut to the heart of it. What the bloody hell is going on? Why do things happen as they do? What drives causality, and why should it matter? What is consciousness? You know—all those deliciously impossible questions that keep philosophers awake at night.

Should we even care about answers?

I've never been particularly sold on Genesis myself. But consider the alternatives: Raven stealing light from the cosmic house, or Tāne pushing apart his sky-father and earth-mother to let light into the world. Even the countless cosmic eggs scattered by some primordial rabbit of creation. Believing any of these requires a leap of faith, doesn't it? But perhaps that's not the point.

What about our modern cosmology of matter and "dead" stuff? Sure, we can verify atoms—until they vanish into probability clouds and wave functions. At least they conform to our scientific laws... until those axioms get overturned every generation or so. Turns out reality is far stranger and less solid than we assumed. Bloody hell, can we set some standards here?

Well, that's exactly what Hodgson attempted. You might ask: who the hell is he to set such standards? Fair point—that's the predicament we're in. What we need is causal closure: an explanation that's hermetically sealed, airtight in its logic yet open to mystery.

My friend, that's precisely what I'm seeking too. Come with me on this journey. Let me entertain you with controlled madness and help us build the sky from your very doorstep. 

But before we depart, let's establish our criteria for a meaningful cosmology:

- **Origination myth**: How did it all begin?
- **Law conformity**: What principles govern the unfolding?
- **Rich narrative structure**: Does it tell a compelling story?
- **Existential foundation**: Does it ground our lived experience?

We'll examine these across a spectrum of cosmoses:

- **Hydrogen cosmos**: The material universe of particles and forces
- **Informational cosmos**: The digital realm of data and computation
- **Living cosmos**: The biosphere and its evolutionary dance
- **Intelligent cosmos**: The emergence of mind and meaning
- **Accountable cosmos**: The realm of ethics and responsibility

Each offers its own answers to the great questions. Each demands we take seriously both wonder and rigor. Let's see what they reveal.
