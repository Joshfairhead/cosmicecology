# Chapter I: Preamble

*This is the second time I've been here, by which I mean now, in this particular moment as this particular character.*

### Circularity

The last few years have been a trip through uncanny valley. No joke, because I'm very much aware that website has already been created once or twice before in different forms, experiences that have already happened are also coming round again and again in different forms. The major difference between then and now simply seems to be that I'm beginning to notice. 

Admittedly there's nothing particualy novel about this assertion as many people throughout history have talked about wheels of time; from the Bhuddist notion of Samsara to famous authors like Robert Jordan. However, it's one thing to grasp the concept intellectually and yet another to recognise this loop - a shock that can be pretty disorienting.

This notion of recursion is no big deal in itself and is fine if your caught in an upwards spiral rather than a vicious cycle, but frustratingly the latter is what I have found myself involved with. That was a major part of the shock, but also provides the opportunity to contribute something new given that necessity is the mother of invention. Beyond noticing a recursive circularity, which can be addressed in a single sentance, there are some interesting learnings related to this general phenomena that seem worth publishing as well as exploring further in order to get myself myself branded an an utter crack pot. 

### Hot Takes

Mystical experiences are probably how cosmologies are born; confronted with the unknown we form an interpretation and then try to represent this in the mediums we have access too. The issue here is that we tend to lack a reference framework, which means that both the interpretive lens and our representative projection are prone to distortion and fragmentation. This is essentially what Bennett resolves in his book "The Dramatic Universe Vol. 1; the foundations of natural philosophy" by justifying a reference framework and set of tools are both accessible to the layman, and useful to the mathmatical specialist - known as General Systematics.

The principals articulated by Bennett are numerous, diciplined and detailed, yet ironically so throughly justified that it's almost impossible not to get lost in the weeds! For those casually interested in the subject of applied cosmology, such work will probably be a case of too much information, or in Bennetts words "a rock of knowledge, when we seek the bread of understanding". 

This is not something I'm claiming to have figured out, but at this point in the road there is a certain wish to share what I've discovered with others who may be facing a similar set of questions regarding whats really going on and more importantly how to work the process in a pragmatic manner, which is where most cosmology seems to fall short. 

What we will attempt to do here is leverage Bennetts explanitory principals in order to explore the subject matter of cosmology and evaluate our findings from a variety of perspectives, which will be done through work outlined by Hodgson in his book "An Introduction to Cosmic Ecology, Searching for a Meaningful Universe" - a short book that essentially uses Bennetts principals to articulate a set of criterea for a meaningful cosmology. 

In other words there are lots of cosmologies, they range in their significance from bed time stories to profound teachings that point to something timeless and beyond words. Their styles differ as well, ranging from paganic narratives of the living land to mathmatical formalisms about the workings of the cosmos, panpsychism and so forth. It's a broad field to say the least, but if it's all just about trancendent beliefs then it's probably of little relevance to our daily lives. Same if it's a catch all blanket term for the matters of materiality. No, a cosmology is not just about knowing stuff for the sake of knowing, its about practical understanding and embodied wisdom. 

But what's wisdom and how can we recognise it?
