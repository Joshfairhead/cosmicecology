# Chapter I: Preamble

*This is the second time I've been here, by which I mean now, in this particular moment as this particular character.*

### Circularity

The last few years have been a journey through uncanny valley. I'm acutely aware that this website has been created before in different forms, that experiences I'm having now have already happened in various iterations. The major difference between then and now is that I'm beginning to notice these patterns.

There's nothing particularly novel about this assertion—throughout history, many have spoken of wheels of time, from the Buddhist notion of Samsara to authors like Robert Jordan. However, grasping the concept intellectually is one thing; recognizing the loop in real time is another entirely—a shock that can be profoundly disorienting.

This notion of recursion isn't inherently problematic—it's fine if you're caught in an upward spiral rather than a vicious cycle. Frustratingly, I've found myself in the latter. This was a major part of the shock, but it also presents an opportunity to contribute something new, as necessity is the mother of invention. Beyond simply noticing recursive circularity—which can be addressed in a single sentence—there are fascinating learnings related to this phenomenon that seem worth publishing and exploring further, even at the risk of being branded an utter crackpot. 

### Hot Takes

Mystical experiences are likely how cosmologies are born: confronted with the unknown, we form an interpretation and attempt to represent it through available mediums. The challenge is that we typically lack a reference framework, leaving both our interpretive lens and representative projections prone to distortion and fragmentation. This is what Bennett addresses in "The Dramatic Universe Vol. 1: The Foundations of Natural Philosophy" by establishing a reference framework and toolset—General Systematics—that is both accessible to laypeople and useful to mathematical specialists.

The principles articulated by Bennett are numerous, disciplined, and detailed, yet ironically so thoroughly justified that it's nearly impossible not to get lost in the weeds. For those casually interested in applied cosmology, such work is likely a case of too much information—or in Bennett's words, "a rock of knowledge, when we seek the bread of understanding." 

I'm not claiming to have figured this out completely, but at this point in my journey, I feel compelled to share what I've discovered with others who may be grappling with similar questions about what's really happening—and more importantly, how to work with these processes pragmatically, which is where most cosmology seems to fall short. 

What we'll attempt here is to leverage Bennett's explanatory principles to explore cosmology and evaluate our findings from multiple perspectives. This will be guided by Hodgson's work in "An Introduction to Cosmic Ecology: Searching for a Meaningful Universe"—a concise book that applies Bennett's principles to articulate criteria for a meaningful cosmology. 

There are countless cosmologies, ranging in significance from bedtime stories to profound teachings that point to something timeless and beyond words. Their styles vary dramatically—from pagan narratives of the living land to mathematical formalisms about cosmic workings, panpsychism, and beyond. It's a vast field, but if it's merely about transcendent beliefs, it holds little relevance for daily life. The same applies if it's just a catch-all term for material concerns. A true cosmology isn't about accumulating knowledge for its own sake—it's about practical understanding and embodied wisdom. 

But what is wisdom, and how can we recognize it?
