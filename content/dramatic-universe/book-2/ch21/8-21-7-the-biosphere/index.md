Life on earth recurrent series of biospheric existences—the biosphere as higher individuality—orthogenesis and epigenesis—Suss, Vernadsky, Goldschmidt, and Vinogradov—structure of the biosphere analogous to colloid—the biosphere transitional from autonomic to hypernomic—concentrations of elements in the earth—energy transformations—solar and lunar influences—succession of biospheres—orthogenetic consciousness.
